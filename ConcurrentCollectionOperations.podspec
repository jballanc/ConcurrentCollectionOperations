    This is a set of categories for performing concurrent map and filter
    operations on Foundation data structures, currently NSArray, NSDictionary,
    NSSet.

    Concurrency is achieved using Grand Central Dispatch's dispatch_apply. By
    default, operations are run on the default priority global concurrent queue
    (DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT). The operations can be performed on any
    concurrent queue, see the category header files.
